# Cluster Monitoring Operator

The Cluster Monitoring Operator manages and updates the Prometheus-based monitoring stack deployed on top of OpenShift.

It contains the following components:

* [Prometheus Operator](https://github.com/coreos/prometheus-operator)
* [Prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus)
* [Alertmanager](https://github.com/prometheus/alertmanager) cluster for cluster and application level alerting
* [kube-state-metrics](https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics)
* [node_exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter)

The deployed Prometheus Operator is meant to be leveraged by users to easily deploy new Prometheus setup for their application monitoring.
The Prometheus instance (`prometheus-k8s`) is responsible for monitoring and alerting on cluster and OpenShift components. It should not be extended to monitor user applications.
Alertmanager is a cluster-global component for handling alerts generated by all Prometheus instances deployed in that cluster.

Metrics are collected from the following components

* [kube-state-metrics](https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics)
* [node_exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter)
* Kubelets
* API server
* Prometheus (just `prometheus-k8s` for now)
* Alertmanager
* Web console

## Contributing new component integrations

The Cluster Monitoring Operator has many builtin `ServiceMonitor` resources which enable discovering the metrics endpoints of a variety of well-known components.

To register a new builtin component, make the following changes:

* Add a new `ServiceMonitor` manifest file to [assets/prometheus-k8s](assets/prometheus-k8s) following the existing `prometheus-k8s-service-monitor-$COMPONENT.yaml` naming convention.
* Add a constant in [pkg/manifests/manifests.go](pkg/manifests/manifests.go) which points to the new manifest file.
* Add a new `Factory` method in [pkg/manifests/manifests.go](pkg/manifests/manifests.go) which loads the manifest using the new constant.
* Add a step to `PrometheusTask` in [pkg/tasks/prometheus.go](pkg/tasks/prometheus.go) which creates the `ServiceMonitor` using the `Factory` new method.

To add a new builtin alerting rule:

* Add a new [Prometheus rules file](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/alerting_rules/) to [rules/k8s](rules/k8s).

Run `make generate` after you modify the files and make sure to add the modified files to the commit.

## Roadmap

* Monitor etcd
* Adapt Tectonic inherited alerts with OpenShift operational knowledge

## Testing

### End-to-end tests

Run e2e-tests with `make e2e-test`.
Clean up after e2e-tests with `make e2e-clean`
